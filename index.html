    				<p> <span class="highLi1">Greenhouse gases</span> are those gases in the atmosphere that raise the <span class="highLi1">surface temperature</span> of planets such as the Earth. What distinguishes them from other gases is that they absorb the <span class="highLi1">wavelengths of radiation</span> that a planet emits, resulting in the greenhouse effect.</p>
    				<p>Normally, the Earthâ€™s temperature is regulated by a balanced amount of greenhouse gases. However, <span class="highLi1">human activities</span> have led to an excessive amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, causing the average global temperature to rise.</p>

    				<p>As the issue of global warming gained prominence, there was a notable shift towards the adoption of <span class="highLi1">eco-friendly products</span> like <span class="highLi1">tumblers</span>, <span class="highLi1">eco bags</span>, and clothing crafted from <span class="highLi1">recycled fibers</span>. However, some critics argue that the enthusiasm for purchasing eco-friendly items has transformed into a form of consumption that, ironically, <span class="highLi1">harms the environment</span>. With heightened consumer interest in environmental matters, companies rushed to introduce eco-friendly product lines.</p>
    				<p>These items have not only become <span class="highLi1">fashionable accessories</span> but are also produced by various brands, often serving as <span class="highLi1">popular souvenirs</span>. The persistent use of tumblers and canvas bags is now contributing to the problem of <span class="highLi1">global warming</span>. A phenomenon in which purchasing eco-friendly products actually harms the environment: Academics call this the <span class="highLi1">"rebound effect"</span>.</p>
