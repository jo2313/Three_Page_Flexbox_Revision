				<div class="smallCon">
    				<p><span class="highLi1">Canvas bags</span> are eco-friendly, crafted from natural materials. They were initially introduced as an alternative to <span class="highLi1">plastic shopping bags</span> but have since evolved into <span class="highLi1">fashionable accessories</span>. Many brands also leverage canvas bags as effective <span class="highLi1">marketing tools</span>. The canvas bag movement gained traction in 2007 when a <span class="highLi1">British fashion designer</span> introduced cloth bags, leading to a significant <span class="highLi1">reduction</span> in the use of plastic bags. However, as the production of canvas bags increased, so did <span class="highLi1">studies</span> examining their overall eco-friendliness. Surprisingly, when assessing the entire lifecycle, from production to disposal, research revealed that one <span class="highLi1">plastic bag may actually be more environmentally friendly than one canvas bag</span>.</p>

    		<h3 class="smallTit">PROBLEM</h3>
    			<div class="smallCon">
    				<p>The problem is that people <span class="highLi1">buy too many eco-bags</span>. There are times when you participate in various events and exhibitions and receive <span class="highLi1">unwanted</span> canvas bags, and indiscriminate production continues. Rather than buying several canvas bags often and using them only <span class="highLi1">once or twice</span> as a concept of fashion, it can be said to be more eco-friendly if you use one plastic bag received from the market several times without throwing it away. As a result, <span class="highLi1">saving</span> and <span class="highLi1">using</span> anything for a <span class="highLi1">long time</span>, instead of unconditionally being eco-friendly, is a <span class="highLi1">helpful behavior</span> for the environment.</p>

    		<h3 class="smallTit">DATA</h3>
    			<div class="smallCon">
    				<p>Canvas bags are made of <span class="highLi1">fiber</span>, so they are <span class="highLi1">difficult</span> to recycle, and it is said that at least <span class="highLi1">131 times</span> should be used to replace plastic bags. A similar study was conducted in Denmark in 2018. As a result of examining the number of times that various packaging bags should be reused to reduce the impact on the environment, plastic bags were found to be at least <span class="highLi1">37 times</span> and paper bags <span class="highLi1">43 times</span>. On the other hand, cotton bags have to be used at least <span class="highLi1">7,100 times</span> to recover <span class="highLi1">contamination</span> generated during production.</p>
