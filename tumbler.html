				<div class="smallCon">
    				<p><span class="highLi1">Tumblers</span> emerged with various <span class="highLi1">appealing designs</span>, such as cherry blossoms and Christmas themes, stoking consumers' <span class="highLi1">desires</span> to collect them. <span class="highLi1">Starbucks</span> tumblers, in particular, <span class="highLi1">boasting a dedicated fan base</span>, consistently report robust sales figures each season. Such <span class="highLi1">indiscriminate purchase</span> of tumblers is actually having a <span class="highLi1">negative</span> impact on the environment. An eye-opening revelation came from the Climate Change Research Institute, which calculated greenhouse gas emissions generated during the production of a single tumbler versus a paper cup. Astonishingly, it was found that a tumbler emits approximately <span class="highLi1">27 times</span> more greenhouse gases than a paper cup.</p>

    		<h3 class="smallTit">PROBLEM</h3>
    			<div class="smallCon">
    				<p>The primary reason for this significant disparity in emissions is the <span class="highLi1">material composition</span>. Tumblers made from <span class="highLi1">stainless steel</span>, <span class="highLi1">silicone rubber</span>, and <span class="highLi1">polypropylene</span> release considerably <span class="highLi1">more greenhouse gases</span> during their manufacturing processes compared to paper or plastic cups. Additionally, emissions continue to accrue through the process of washing tumblers and disposing of discarded ones, further exacerbating the overall <span class="highLi1">greenhouse gas footprint</span>.</p>

    		<h3 class="smallTit">DATA</h3>
    			<div class="smallCon">
    				<p>According to the Institute for life cycle energy analysis <span class="highLi1">(CIRAIG)</span>, to genuinely contribute to environmental preservation, polypropylene tumblers must be used more than <span class="highLi1">50 times</span>, and the commonly encountered stainless steel tumblers need to be used over <span class="highLi1">220 times</span> to offset their environmental impact.</p>
